# If the compilation fails, it may be because g++ doesn't know
# where to find the include files and the library for NTL.
# You may need to add -I include_directory and -L library_directory
# options.  For example, if NTL installed into /home/username/sw directory,
#   on mac, use 'brew install ntl' and then find out the installed path
# then you should replace the CXXFLAGS line below with
# CXXFLAGS = -Wno-deprecated -I /home/username/sw/include -L /home/username/sw/lib
#
# To find out where NTL is, look for the directory that has a
# subdirectory called include with a subdirectory NTL in it 
# and a subdirectory called lib with a file libntl.a in it.
# NTL creates these when you install it according to NTL instructions.
# See http://www.shoup.net/ntl for more.
